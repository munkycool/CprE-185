# Take heed

Please be cool. If you find this, don't cheat and just copy my work. You can use this work, you can get ideas from it. But be cool about it. Give credit where it's due, Artemis Ulysses Tack. I also know that some of ya'll don't quite know about licencing yet. Since this is GPLv3 that means that you have to license your code as GPLv3 if you use this work.

TLDR: Be cool about it.
