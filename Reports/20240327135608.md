# An introduction and credits

## Credits

First off, I want to give proper credits to where it’s due. I love copyleft and the open sharing of ideas. I don’t love plaragirsm. So thanks to (and I’m sorry I’m so terrible with names) the TA who spent an hour with me trying to debug my code, and thanks to the TA who suggested that I used commas in the `scanf` statement, which fixed the problems that I was having. 

Also thanks to [Joshua Bump on GitHub](https://github.com/jtbump97). Their CPRE 185 repo on GitHub, and specifically for this project, their lab7.c code. I tried not to just directly copy from them, but I was inspired by them enough that I should give their proper credit. 

## The introduction to end all introductions

I thought that last week's lab was difficult. And then I met this week's lab. To be fair, I think that it would have been easier if I hadn’t spent an hour with a TA staring at code that had nothing else wrong except for some missing commas. But, regardless, this lab was for sure a time sink. Although, looking at this week's lab, it seems to be ready to top that challenge. I miss when the labs were easy. A time when I could sit down and bang out a lab in a couple of hours. Ah well, it’s still pretty fun at least. When it works. 

It’s kinda like this. I’ll get some serotonin when something works. And then I’ll spend awhile banging my head against a wall trying to get the next thing to work. Just about when I’m about to give up all hope, it works! And then I’ll get just enough serotonin to continue onto the next problem. Basically, it’s the wildest of roller coasters, and I’m just along for the ride. 

# Questions and experiments 

## Q1 How did you scale the values?

```c
int scaleMagForScreen(double rad) {
    return (int) (rad * 39*PI/2);
}
```

```c
int scaleJoyForScreen(int rad) {
    return (int) (rad / 3.28);
}
```

These two functions are how I scaled the values. I’m going to start in order, so let’s take a look at `scaleMagForScreen`. 

In truth, I chose this exact equation because it’s what the TA told me would work, and would work the best. So yeah, that’s the why. And I suppose looking at the code, it’s simple enough to explain the how. It typecasts return as an integer type value. It then uses whatever value is set as `rad`. In my case, `roll(x)` and `pitch(y)`. It then multiplies that value by 39, multiplies that by PI (defined earlier) and then divides that by 2. As to why it’s scaled to 39, I’d guess that it’s because of the requirement to print at column 40. So, therefore, it scales it to fit within those constraints?

Now that `scaleMagForScreen` is out of the way, let’s take a look at `scaleJoyForScreen`.

This equation is even more simple. It typecasts it as an integer, and then divides `rad` (in my case `j_LX`) by 3.28. Why it’s 3.28… I honestly have no idea. I know that it works, and seemingly works quite well as far as I can tell. But I’m not sure as to why it is 3.28. Luckily, per the question, I don’t think I have to explain it fully. I can just say, and justify it, as “it just works”. 

## Q2 What happens near the limits?

As I reached the limits, with the roll and the pitch (NOT the joystick) it would loop back on itself. So if the “l”s reach the end of the screen, then they would, starting at the end of the screen, start to work itself back into the middle. I don’t remember exactly, and I’ll change this if I do figure it out exactly. But I don’t think that it would do the same thing on the other side. So, for the “r”s I think that it just stopped at 80 characters, and wouldn’t loop back in on itself. I’m not sure why the difference, or why it didn’t do the same thing with the joystick. That is what happened, though. 

# Looking at some jank ass code :p

## Changing the modes 

```c
        /* Scan a line of input */
        flag = 0; 

        if (b_Right == 1) {
            flag = 1;
        }

        read_input(&t, &x, &y, &z, &b_Up, &b_Down, 
        &b_Left, &b_Right, &j_LX, &j_LY, &j_RX, &j_RY);
        /* Calculate and scale for pitch AND roll AND joystick */

        if (flag == 1) {
            b_Right = 0;
        }

        printf("\n%d", b_Right);

        /* Switch between roll, pitch, and joystick with the 
        up, down, and right button, respectivly */

        /* Output your graph line */

        if (switch_mode == 1) {
            scaled_pitch = scaleMagForScreen(pitch(y));
            graph_line(scaled_pitch);
            if (b_Right == 1) {
                switch_mode++;
                if (switch_mode > 3) {
                    switch_mode = 1;
                }
            }
       // printf("1");
    }
        if (switch_mode == 2) {
            scaled_roll = scaleMagForScreen(roll(x));
            graph_line(scaled_roll);
            if (b_Right == 1) {
                switch_mode++;
                if (switch_mode > 3) {
                    switch_mode = 1;
                }
        }
     //   printf("2");
    }
        if (switch_mode == 3) {
            scaled_joy = scaleJoyForScreen(j_LX);
            graph_line(scaled_joy);
            if (b_Right == 1) {
                switch_mode++;
                if (switch_mode > 3) {
                    switch_mode = 1;
                }
        }
```
p.s. Thanks to the TA who looked at this for almost an hour on a Monday night trying to get it fixed. 

So... this didn’t work. But hey, at least I tried. And that’s what matters, right? Right?!?!?!?!??!

The logic on this is as follows. It sets `flag` to zero. Then, if `b_Right` (the square button) is 1 (so being pressed down) it sets `flag = 1`. It then reads in all the inputs, and if `flag` is equal to 1, meaning that the square button is being pressed, it will set `b_Right` equal to zero. Then it enters the first case, because `switch_mode` is initialized to 1. It will display the pitch of the controller. But if `b_Right` is read as 1, so it’s pressed. What should happen is that it adds 1 to `switch_mode`, unless `switch_mode > 3`, which is the highest value of `switch_mode` that has any use to us here. So `switch_mode` now equals to 2. Meaning that it _should_ graph `scaled_roll`. 

But, as seemingly always happens with these sorts of things, something goes wrong! What does happen is that, so long as `b_Right == 1` it will cycle through possible values of `switch_mode`. Landing on the value that it’s set at when `b_Right` no longer equals 1. In other words, so long as the square button is being held down, it will cycle through values of `switch_mode`, and will display all possible configurations at once. And if you let go, it will keep on doing what it was last doing. 

## How I exit the code if the right button is pressed. 

```c
        if (b_Left == 1) {
            exit(0);
        }
```

I use what has quickly become one of my favorite functions in C. The `exit(0)` command. So if `b_Left == 1` the program will exit. Since `b_Left` is mapped to the X button for some godforsaken reason (real answer is laziness), if the X button is pressed, then the program will exit. This code works perfectly!

## Taking some Ls (by graphing them)

```c
void print_chars(int num, char use) {
    for (int i = 0; i < num; i++) {
        printf("%c", use);
    }
}
```

AND

```c
void graph_line(int number) {
   int i = 0;

    if (number < 0){
        i = number + 100;
        print_chars( i,  ' ');
        print_chars( -number, 'l');
    }
    else if ( number > 0) {
        print_chars( 100,  ' ');
        print_chars( number, 'r');
    }
    else if (number == NAN) {
        printf("NAN");
    }
    else{
        print_chars( 100,  ' ');
        print_chars ( 1, '0');
    }

    print_chars(1, '\n');
}
```

The major thing that I want to point out here is that I’m using 100 instead of 40. The reason that I’m using 100 is the fact that it wasn’t centered was starting to really annoy me. So I wanted to change that, and, on my screen and with my preferred terminal width, 100 was the value that was about in the middle. I didn’t bother changing any of the scaling, and everything seemed to work perfectly fine. Not sure what’s up with that, but it works, so I ain’t complaining. 

The `number` comes from `scaled_pitch`, `scaled_roll` and `scaled_joy`. Or the scaled value of the magnitudes of the inputs. It then determines if it’s negative, positive, or 0. Or, technically, NAN (it should really be `else if (number == is_NAN)` but whatever), but this was just put in more for testing and then never taken out. Anyway, it then prints i number of spaces, and then -number amount of “l”s if the number is negative. If the number is positive it then prints basically the same thing, except in the opposite direction. Very cool indeed. 

# An ending and what I’ve learned. 

I’ve learned that I can write alot of code where I’m just writing and adding things to it, but I don’t necisarily know what it does. I just know that it works. In order to help fix that in the future, I think that I should probably have better documentation. Whether that be by writing the lab report alongside of writing the code. Or just having better inline coments, I just think that I really need to know what’s going on a lot better. 

I’m also going to start using GitHub for versioning control. I think that it’ll make some things easier, esspecially when I mess something up and have to go back to an earlier version. It’ll also be more like something that I would be doing in real life, so it would be a great learning experience. I already created a repo with all my CPR E 185 material on GitHub, and I plan on using it in the future. 

Untill next time,
