Before we start, I wasn’t really sure about what to put in here. So I kinda just talked about the interesting bits of my code, and the design a little bit. I hope that it fits the requirements, and that ya’ll enjoy reading it.

# An introduction 

Going into this project, there was a couple, overarching, things that I wanted to take into account. 

1. I wanted the code to actually be pretty. Coming off of the back of a not so great lab 06, in which the code was all over the place, I wanted to work hard to make this code be as pretty and as readable as possible
2. Increasingly as I was working on this I came to realize that I didn’t just want to build something, but build something that I could be proud of. To that end I put in a few really cool touches that I think elevate this to the next level. Of which I’ll be talking about more in depth later; The two big things that I wanted to include was a cute loading screen and a simple memory safety feature

# Part 1 - Looking at some pretty cool code 

## Memory saftey?

As I’m a cybersecurity engineering major, I figured that I might as well have some sort of memory safety built into the program. 

```c
// memory saftey cuz I'm dat bitch
if (strlen(question1) > 10) {
	exit(0);
}
```

The way that this works is by checking the length of `question1` and seeing if it’s over 10, which is the maximum amount of characters that the array can hold. If it detects that `question1`, or whatever question the user is answering, is over the maximum ammount of charectors allowed for, it exits. I belive that this should help to mitigate a buffer overflow type attack.

## A very cool loading animation 

While modern computers can do the calculations that’s needed basically instantly, for a “better” UX I decided to make the user wait a couple seconds before the grade is shown. So I wanted to include a basic loading animation inspired by the pacman tool on Arch Linux (BTW I use Arch). When you download a program you can have a little pacman eating food as the download progress bar. So I went over to GitHub Copilot and asked it to create some cute little ASCII art because I’m terrible at art (except photography, ngl I kinda slap at photography). 

```c
// function to make a simple loading screen that reminds me of the Arch Linux pacman install loading bar
int loadingScreen() {

    // Some weird time lord shit
    struct timespec sleepTime;
    sleepTime.tv_sec = 0;
    sleepTime.tv_nsec = 250000000L;

    // ASCII Art frames graciously made by chatGPT because I'm really bad at art :(
    char* frames[21] = {
        "\nC...................",
        " c..................",
        "  C.................",
        "   c................",
        "    C...............",
        "     c..............",
        "      C.............",
        "       c............",
        "        C...........",
        "         c..........",
        "          C.........",
        "           c........",
        "            C.......",
        "             c......",
        "              C.....",
        "               c....",
        "                C...",
        "                 c..",
        "                  C.",
        "                   c",
        "                    \n",
    };

    // Loop to animate frames
    for (int i = 0; i < 21; ++i) {
        printf("\r%s", frames[i]);
        fflush(stdout);
        nanosleep(&sleepTime, NULL);
    }
    printf("\n");
    return 0;
}
```

So let’s break it down a little bit and talk about each part. 

I chose to, instead of doing it in the code, have a function that I could call. Once again, choosing to make the code a bit prettier, as well as adding to the readability of what was already quite a long project. 

```c
// Some weird time lord shit
    struct timespec sleepTime;
    sleepTime.tv_sec = 0;
    sleepTime.tv_nsec = 250000000L;
```

It first declares the `sleepTime` variable as a type of `struct timespec`. Meaning that it holds a specific length of time. It then assigns it to hold 250 mili nanoseconds, or 0.25 seconds. This will come into play later in the code. 

```c
// ASCII Art frames graciously made by chatGPT because I'm really bad at art :(
    char* frames[21] = {
        "\nC...................",
        " c..................",
        .
        .
        .
        "                    \n",
```

This creates a string variable called `frames` that can hold 21 things. Each “thing” being a pointer to a different animation. 

```c
    for (int i = 0; i < 21; ++i) {
        printf("\r%s", frames[i]);
        fflush(stdout);
        nanosleep(&sleepTime, NULL);
    }
```

This creates a for loop that iterates for 21 times, or the amount of frames that I have. It prints `frame[i]`. Then it clears the output buffer. After that it sleeps the program for `sleepTime`, which, as stated earlier, is 0.25 seconds. 

## Does case really matter? I don’t think so

i had read, or watched something, I don’t remember, that said that some case-insensitive things (I think it was a shell language or something) achieved this by making everything an uppercase letter. I decided to do the same thing but opposite here, so that the user could enter case in any order for their answers. And, so long as they’re right, the program will accept them. 

```c
// function to make a question lowercase
int makeQuestionLowercase(char question[]) {
    for (int i = 0; i < strlen(question); i++) {
        question[i] = tolower(question[i]);
    }
    return 0;
}
```

So the user passes through a character string, `question[]`. The string is then input into a for loop that runs for the length of the string. It sets `question[i]` as a lowercase letter. Making it case-insensitive. Very cool indeed :)

## What about retakes? Or if they get a question wrong?

Yet again I just kinda had a hunch that something would be a feature of C. That hunch was that I could use `goto` and point to a specific part of my code to go to. And, lo and behold, it is a feature in C. And one that I took advantage of. 

This is the code from quiz 2 question 1 for example:

```c
        if (strcmp(question1, "false") == 0) {
            points += 15;
        }
        else {
            printf("Sorry, try again\n");
            if (points < 0) {
                goto quizTwoQuestionOne;
            }
            points -= 15;
            goto quizTwoQuestionOne;
        }
```

`quizTwoQuestionOne` resides on line 199, right before the start of said quiz 2 question 1. 

And if the user wants to retake the quiz? I do something similar. 

```c
    // Checking if the user wants to retake the quiz
    if (strcmp(retake, "yes") == 0 || strcmp(retake, "Yes") == 0 || strcmp(retake, "YES") == 0) {
        goto quizStart;
    }
    else {
        printf("Bye!\n");
        exit(0);
    }
```

With `quizStart` residing on line 84, near the top of the program. Crucially, however, it’s before any variable declarations. This is to ensure that each time the total score remains the same. Meaning that the average score at the end will be from across **all** attempts, and not just the attempt that the user is currently on. 

## Randomization 

Luckily for us, this is dead simple. 

```c
    // generating the quiz number that the user will take 
    srand (magicNumber);
    quizNumber = rand() % 3 + 1;
```

The user inputs a number from 1 to 9, which gets stored in the `magicNumber` variable. Then the seed is set using said `magicNumber`. Then the variable `quizNumber` is assigned with a random number from 1 to 3, which will be whatever quiz that the user will have to take. 

# Part two - Do you want to build a ~~snowman~~ quiz?

At first, I was going to build my own, custom, questions. And I did… for the first question. Then I got board and just copied questions from the lecture quizzes. It was kinda hard to select ones that wouldn’t have to have me format some code within the terminal, which seemed like more trouble than it’s worth. But I found 8 that worked!

## The delightful quiz # 1

I’ll just list the questions that I decided to put in the question. 

Question 1:
> Please type 'true' or 'false' for the following question (not case sensitive)
> Question 1: true or false, in the context of Linux, when pronouncing 'gnu' or 'gnome' the g is silent?

Question 2:
> Please type the corresponding letter for the following question (not case sensitive)
> Question 2: Convert the decimal number 3477 to binary
> A) 110110010101
> B) 110110010110
> C) 110110010111
> D) 110110011000

Question 3: 
> Please fill in the blank
> Question 3: To declare a string in C, you would use what syntax? ______ stringName \[10\]

For the sake of space and both my time and yours, I won’t print out the contents of each quiz. But I’m sure you get the idea, and it kinda goes on like that. With each quiz following the same basic format of true/false, select the right letter, and fill in the blank.
