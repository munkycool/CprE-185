Author’s note: 
The screenshots won’t be as pretty as usual. This is because I had to use the lab computers, instead of being about to use my beautifully customized macOS terminal.

# Problem 1

1. I played around a bit with the flags just to get a feel of how it worked
2. I then piped the data into two `.csv` files, and set them aside for later. Because I knew that was something that I could work on outside of the lab, unlike the work with the DS4 controllers.
3. I forgot to collect the simple movement of the DS4 controller :(
4. I struggled because I’m an Excel noob, and produced a couple “beautiful” graphs.

On both of the graphs, the X axis is time, and the Y axis is the gyroscope values.

# Problem 2

1. I edited the line in section 0 so that the milliseconds were printed as numbers.
2. I then changed the magnitude function so that it would report the magniture
3. I then created new functions, `minutes`, `seconds`, and `miliseconds`. I used the formulas that I created in this week's pre-lab in order to convert the values from the variable`t`, which was reported in milliseconds, to their respective values.
4. I tested, and it worked. Win!!!

# Problem 3

1. I misread the problem and thought that we had to get what button was being pressed, and not the number of buttons
    2. I started to mentally scope out the problem and how I would accomplish it
2. I reread the problem and realized that it was to output the number of buttons being pressed. I then breathed a sigh of relief.
3. I knew that the output from `ds4rd.exe` was `0,0,0,1` for the square button, and so on. So the more buttons were being pressed, the higher the number it would be. 1 for 1 button, 2 for two buttons and so on.
4. I created an `if else` statement to print the number of buttons based on the values of the input from `ds4rd.exe` added together
5. I didn’t have any output, and a very nice TA told me about the `fflush(stout);` statement. And, drumroll please… it worked!!!
6. I also showed it working to a TA. Not sure if that’s the “lab demo” that the rubric is talking about, but it’s something.

While it’s pretty hard to see, the numbers that you see in the Cygwin window is the numbers changing as different numbers of buttons were pressed.
