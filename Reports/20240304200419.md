# Problem 1 - and I’m already confused...

I find it quite ironic that the steps detailing how the program must work emphasizes efficiency and a “less is more” approach, while at the same time I don’t think that the approach that it gives is a very good way. I think a better way would be to have the user enter the exam scores in a for loop, and the homework scores in a for loop, storing the total results into a `avg_hw` and `avg_exam` variables. Then it would calculate the `avg_hw` and `avg_exam` by dividing by 5 and 3 respectively. Then calculating a `weighted_avg` variable and printing that. 

I just don’t see what the point of an array for everything is, or what it accomplished other than needless complexity and needless lines of code. 

## The code

I was a bit confused about whether I was supposed to create an array to hold ALL the averages, or to create an individual array for EACH average (which at that point would just be a variable). In the end, I just decided to store the averages in a variable each. I don’t think there’s any difference in terms of code length, and I personally find that assigning them all to the same array would have been harder to read. 

    #include <stdio.h>

	int main() {
    double hwScore[5];
    double examScore[3];
    double hwTotal, examTotal, finalScore;
    int i, j;

    for (i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        printf("Enter homework grade %d: ", i + 1);
        scanf("%lf", &hwScore[i]);
    }

    for (i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
        printf("Enter exam grade %d: ", i + 1);
        scanf("%lf", &examScore[i]);
    }

    hwTotal = hwScore[0] + hwScore[1] + hwScore[2] + hwScore[3] + hwScore[4];
    examTotal = examScore[0] + examScore[1] + examScore[2];
    finalScore = (hwTotal / 5) * 0.4 + (examTotal / 3) * 0.6;

    printf("Final score: %.2lf\n", finalScore);
	}

## Sample inputs and outputs 

- For the homework grade:
    - 90
    - 98
    - 58
    - 98
    - 4
- For the exam grade
    - 99
    - 2
    - 100

# Problem 2 - 2D arrays, my old arch enemy 

Okay, first to figure out what the fuck the question’s asking me. See, usually I can just scope out the problem in my head, but then with arrays it’s just kinda complicated, so I think I’m first going to sketch it out:

|   | Student 1 | Student 2 |
|---|-----------|-----------|
| 0 | grade 1   | grade 1   |
| 1 | grade 2   | grade 2   |
| 2 | grade 3   | grade 3   |
| 3 | grade 4   | grade 4   |

Then, after I get the student’s grade, I need to calculate the average and store it in a `average` function. Then I make a `letter_grade` function that decides the letter grade using a series of `elif` statements. 

Okay, so I have a plan, now to execute it.

## The code 

    #include <stdio.h>

    double averageGrade(double hwScore[4]) {
        double total = 0;
        int i;
        for (i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
            total += hwScore[i];
        }
        return total / 4;
    }
    
    char letterGrade(double averageGrade) {
        if (averageGrade >= 85 && averageGrade <= 100) {
            return 'A';
        } 
        else if (averageGrade >= 75 && averageGrade < 85) {
            return 'B';
        } 
        else if (averageGrade >= 60 && averageGrade < 75) {
            return 'C';
        } 
        else {
            return 'F';
        }
    }
    
    int main() {
        double hwScore[2][4];
        int i, j;

    for (i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
        for (j = 0; j < 4; j++) {
            printf("Enter student %d's homework grade %d: ", i + 1, j + 1);
            scanf("%lf", &hwScore[i][j]);
        }
    }

    for (i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
        printf("The average grade for student %d is %.2lf", i + 1, averageGrade(hwScore[i]));
        printf(" and the letter grade is %c\n", letterGrade(averageGrade(hwScore[i])));
    }

    return 0;
	}

And… it works!!! The hardest part was trying to remember the order that the for loops were supposed to go in. 

edit: it did not work :(

The problem was that the exam scores were all the same. So after much troubleshooting and hair pulling I was able to get it working. The only thing that kept me going was Clippy chilling in the bottom left corner of my screen.

## Sample i/o

- Student 1
    - hw 1: 98
    - hw 2: 87
    - hw 3: 67
    - hw 4: 5
- Student 2
    - hw 1: 87
    - hw 2: 78
    - hw 3: 99
    - hw 4: 89
