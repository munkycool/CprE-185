# How did I approach the design?

The first thing that I did was just look at the raw data that the controller was outputting in order to figure out what values were changing based on the orientation of the controller. Based on that, I used the variables `gy` and `gx` in order to get the front to back and left to right orientation, respectively. 

# What data did I read in?

Based on what I figured out while looking at changing values, I decided to read in the values from `gy` and `gx`. Then, from importing the `magnitude()` function from an earlier lab, I read in `x` `y` and `z`. I’m going to be honest, I never actually said in the code what the `x` `y` and `z` variables did, I just straight copied and pasted it from lab 03. So I’m not sure why or how it worked, but all I know is that it did, so I ain’t really complaining. 

# What functions did I impliment?

I implemented three functions in the program that i made. 

-  `int close_to_gy(double tolerance, double point_gy, double value);`
    -  This function determines what direction the control is on the z (I know it says and reads as y, but in my mind it makes more sense to visualize it on the z axis). So if it’s facing up, down, pointing up, or pointing down.
-  `int close_to_gx(double tolerance, double point_gx, double value);`
    -  This is the variable that determines what direction the function is on the x axis. So if it’s on its right or left side. 
-  `double magnitude(double x, double y, double z);`
    -  This is the function that determines whether or not the controller is moving or not. 

# What tollerance values did I decide on?

I decided on the value of 0.05 for the tolerance value. I chose this value because found that it was a good compromise between exactness and frustration of trying to get it close enough to the exactness in order to print the desired value. 

# I’m not sure what else to put, so I’ll just share some interesting tidbits about parts of my code.

- The way that I exited the program by pressing the triangle is by using a `if` statement, and then having `exit(0)` inside the `if` function. I remembered that function from when I was learning Python, and, without checking to see it was also in C just put the function in and prayed. Lo and behold, it worked!
- I decide to have all my source code in this class licensed as GPLv3 for several reasons. One, because it (legally) guarantees that the source code is available for all code I write. Which I think is just kinda funny because of how much in engineering 101 they pressured us against sharing “answers” to problems. And two, I’m just a HUGE supporter of open source and copy left (the reason this doc is licensed under CC, and my poetry site, poetry.art3mix.com, is also licensed under a CC license).
