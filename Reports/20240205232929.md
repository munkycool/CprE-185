# The source code

Okay, so let’s just get the boring part out of the way first

## Phone number 
`

	// included libraries 
	#include <stdio.h>

    int main() {
    
    // Declares the variable
        long int phone_number;
     
    // Gets the phone number from the inputer
        printf("Enter a phone number: ");
        scanf("%ld", &phone_number);
    
    // Prints their phone number, wonderfully arranged for those who can't easily parse 9 digits
        printf("The area code is: %ld\n", phone_number / 10000000);
        printf("The exchange code is: %ld\n", (phone_number / 10000) % 1000);
        printf("The user number is: %ld\n", phone_number % 10000);
`

## Distance

`

	// Libraries are important, fuck the Iowa State legislature 
	#include <stdio.h>
	#include <math.h>

	int main() {

    // The wonderfully marvelous varibale declarations
    double mike_x, mike_y;
    double mary_x, mary_y;
    double garry_x, garry_y;
    double logan_x, logan_y;
    double school_x, school_y;
    double mikeDistance, maryDistance, garryDistance, loganDistance;


    // The school distances that I totally didn't forget the first time
    school_x = 15.55;
    school_y = 55.15;

    // equations for a green cyclops monster
    mike_x = 22.05;
    mike_y = 85.10;
    mikeDistance = sqrt(pow(mike_x - school_x, 2) + pow(mike_y - school_y, 2));

    // I hope Mary finds her lamb
    mary_x = 43.25;
    mary_y = 9.80;
    maryDistance = sqrt(pow(mary_x - school_x, 2) + pow(mary_y - school_y, 2));

    // No notes, only GARRY
    garry_x = 2.55;
    garry_y = 72.86;
    garryDistance = sqrt(pow(garry_x - school_x, 2) + pow(garry_y - school_y, 2));

    // God, I hope it's not the Paul
    logan_x = 15.15;
    logan_y = 40.40;
    loganDistance = sqrt(pow(logan_x - school_x, 2) + pow(logan_y - school_y, 2));

    // Printing the results of all the distances. I hope it's not miles...
    printf("The E distance for Mike is: %f\n", mikeDistance);
    printf("The E distance for Mary is: %f\n", maryDistance);
    printf("The E distance for Garry is: %f\n", garryDistance);
    printf("The E distance for Logan is: %f\n", loganDistance);

    return 0;

# Sample inputs and outputs

## Distance

![Sample output for distance.c](../../../../../var/folders/5g/j999d2qx21g5wj5_s669vg5w0000gn/T/TemporaryItems/NSIRD_screencaptureui_GqpkzK/Screenshot 2024-02-05 at 23.34.47.png "Sample output for distance.c")

Since everything about this program is fixed, and requires no user input, I thought it appropreit to just show the output of the program. 

## Phone Number 

![Sample phone number input/output](../../../../../var/folders/5g/j999d2qx21g5wj5_s669vg5w0000gn/T/TemporaryItems/NSIRD_screencaptureui_i5mKOO/Screenshot 2024-02-05 at 23.36.23.png "Sample phone number i/o")

This is an example of user i/o in the form of my phone number (please don’t call).
