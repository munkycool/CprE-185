# Problem 1

I didn’t encounter any problems when making this project. I just did a couple of `printf()` statements and everything was fine. I’m not sure if something was supposed to go wrong...

# Problem 2

I copied the code from Canvas, and put it into `lab01-2.c` 

This is the output of the program, as shown it correctly calculated the area of a rectangle

## It’s cubes time

I modified the code by adding a `z` variable, and changing the formula used to `2*(x*y + y*z + x*z)`

I then ran the program using a 2x64x8 cube.

# Problem 3

## What went wrong?

I observed 3 problems with the code in provided. 

1. The tag was `%lf`, which is the tag for double values, when the variable was an integer
2. The variable tag, `integer_results` was missing from the `printf()` statement
3. The tag was `%d`, which is the tag for integer values, when the variable was a double statement

## The full corrected program: 


	int main(int argc, char *argv[])

	{ 

	int integer_result;

	double decimal_result

	integer_result = 77 / 5;

	printf("The value of 77/5 is %d, using integer math.\n", integer_result); // changed the %lf to %d

	integer_result = 2 + 3;

	printf("The value of 2+3 is %d.\n", integer_result); // added the integer_result tag to the printf statement

	decimal_result = 1.0 / 22.0;

	printf("The value 1.0/22.0 is %lf.\n", decimal\_result); //added the %lf tag to the printf statement

	return 0;

	} 

# Problem 4

I created variables for the repeated numbers to make my life a little bit easier. 

I then painstakingly typed out all of the problems. 

## The area of a circle. 

I remembered that pi is included in the `math.h` library, so I added `#include<math.h>` at the top of the code so that I could use the `M_PI` tag, something necesary for finding the area of a circle. 

1. I added a new variable, `circumference` to list the given circumference of the circle
2. I added a new variable `radius` to calculate the radius of the circle
    3. The radius of a circle is `circuference / (2 * PI)`, so the code is `circumference / (2 * M_PI)`
3. I added a new variable, area, that then calculated the area of the circle
    4. The area is `PI * radius^2`, so the code that I wrote is `double area = M_PI * pow(radius, 2);`

## Converting feet to meters (ps I just googled a formula, I didn’t use the ratio given in the lab02 doc)

1. I created a new variable called `feet`
2. I then created a new variable called `meters` and set it to convert the meters from feet
    3. The formula is meters = feet / 3.28084
    4. So the code is `double meters = feet / 3.28084`


## Converting fahrenhiet to celsius (ps, much like the feet to meters, I just googled the formula. In truth because I just didn’t see the other ones until writing this)

1. I created a new variable called Fahrenheit
2. I created a new variable called Celsius that would convert Fahrenheit into Celsius for me
    3. The formula is `(F - 32) * (5.0 / 9.0)`
    4. So the code I wrote is `double celsius = (fahrenheit - 32) * (5.0 / 9.0);`


## The final outputs:

# Problem 5

AKA the problem that I ended up hyper focusing on for an hour and went a bit above and beyond. So you can enter any combination of a, b, and c and get the unknown side.

The result of the required input (checked online for accuracy, and it’s indeed accurate!):
