    4. `int number = 69; // Change the zero to a different number.`
4. I compiled the program into  ./output
5. I ran the program and produced this output:

# UNIX is amazing, and macOS is UNIX certified 

## Some fun UNIX shenanigans 

Basically, I just piped `./output` into `./input` and then had it overwrite the file `test.txt` as the output of both of those commands. Below is what appeared on the terminal.
