# The Adventures of the Amazing Problem One 

## The source code: 

	#include <stdio.h>
	#include <stdlib.h>

	int main() {
    char letter = 'a';

    for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
        printf("%c\n", letter);
        letter++;
    }
	}

## The output

Since this is a problem with fixed i/o I’ll simply put a screenshot of the output here.

# Problem number 2 - more fun :)

It was an unusually hot Monday afternoon in late February. My MacBook screen bouncing slightly in the warm wind, I was sitting outside the Student Innovation Center looking at the problem. Slowly at first, and then faster as the sketches in my head came into focus I figured out what to do. Multiple `for` loops in order to check each character against a given set of conditions! Excitedly I wandered around for a bit before going up to the third floor of the library, out of the wind, to put thoughts to terminal (or VS Code lol). 

Fast-forward half an hour, and I was just about to export this as a pdf and be done with this when I got to thinking. I probably didn’t actually need multiple `for` loops in order to complete this project. So I deleted them, and compiled the new code to see if it still worked. Bated breath, I slowly typed `./1` into iTerm2 (my terminal app of choice) and pressed enter. It worked perfectly! 

## The source code

	int main() {
    	char password[50];

    printf("Please enter a simple password: ");
    scanf("%s", password);

    for (int i = 0; i < 50; i++) {

            if (password[i] == 'i') {
                password[i] = '1';
            }
            if (password[i] == 'a') {
                password[i] = '@';
            }
            if (password[i] == 'm') {
                password[i] = 'M';
            }
            if (password[i] == 'B') {
                password[i] = '8';
            }
            if (password[i] == 's') {
                password[i] = '$';
            }
    }

    printf("Your new password is: %s\n", password);
    printf("\nPlease note that length is usually the most immportant factor in password security (barring phishing and other social engineering fun),\nso you're new password might not neccessarily be considered secure. - sencerily a cybersecurity major\n");

	}

## Sample i/o

I’m just going to sample this with the password that the `quiz 4.pdf` does, as well as entering the totally real password for my Bitwarden account. 

- `mypassword!` - from the quiz doc
- `Hunter2` - because why not?
- `artemistackisthebest-hellyeah!` - my totally real Bitwarden password
