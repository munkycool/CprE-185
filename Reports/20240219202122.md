# Problem number 1 

## Source code



    # include <stdio.h>
    
    int main() {
      int grade = 0;
    
      printf("Enter your grade: ");
      scanf("%d", &grade);
    
      if (grade > 100) {
        printf("Invalid grade\n");
      } else if (grade >= 93) {
        printf("Your grade letter is A\n");
      } else if (grade >= 90) {
        printf("Your grade letter is A-\n");
      } else if (grade >= 87) {
        printf("Your grade letter is B+\n");
      } else if (grade >= 83) {
        printf("Your grade letter is B\n");
      } else if (grade >= 80) {
        printf("Your grade letter is B-\n");
      } else if (grade >= 77) {
        printf("Your grade letter is C+\n");
      } else if (grade >= 73) {
        printf("Your grade letter is C\n");
      } else if (grade >= 70) {
        printf("Your grade letter is C-\n");
      } else if (grade >= 67) {
        printf("Your grade letter is D+\n");
      } else if (grade >= 63) {
        printf("Your grade letter is D\n");
      } else if (grade >= 60) {
        printf("Your grade letter is D-\n");
      } else if (grade >= 0) {
        printf("Your grade letter is F\n");
      } else {
        printf("Invalid grade\n");
      }
    }


## Sample i/o

The input was as follows: `92` and `86` for two different percent grades that I tested.

The output of the program was the following:

# Problem 2

## Source code 



    #include <stdio.h>
    #include <string.h>
    
    int main() {
        char userName[30];
        char password[30];
    
        printf("Enter your username: ");
        scanf("%s", userName);
    
        printf("Enter your password: ");
        scanf("%s", password);
    
        if (strcmp(userName, "se185@iastate.edu") == 0 && strcmp(password, "ds4rd") == 0){
            printf("Success!\n");
        } else {
            printf("Username or password is incorrect.\n");
        }
    
        return 0;
    }



## Sample i/o

While I did sample it with hi for the username and password because it’s shorter during testing, what I’ll actually be showing is just what it was supposed to be because it’s fixed. As well as a couple random words to demonstrate a fail state. 

So the input that I used was: `se185@iastate.edu` for the username, and `ds4rd` for the password. I also used `hi` and `wassup` to demonstrate a fail state.

The output was the following:
