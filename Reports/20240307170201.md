# The lab that almost broke me - an introduction 

I’m going to be completely honest here. This was by far the hardest lab so far (including the midterm project). As well as having my worst written code. Seriously, I’m sorry to whoever has to read through what I’ve made this week, because even I’m confused with what’s going on in there. 

This was also the first lab that I found that I was unable to complete and demo fully inside of lab time. Even if in the past I had worked on the project beforehand, I was still able to demo it in lab, here I couldn’t. Also, I have to be honest, having office hours in the TLA is kinda weird because I’ll see a TA has office hours, but there’s like 30 people in the TLA and I don’t know what the TA looks like, so from there I don’t really know what to do lmao. 

# What the game plan was going into this

I had several goals going into this project. 

- I wanted to be able to use the `options` button to start the program
- I wanted to use every (except for the weird touchscreen button on the face) button on the controller

I then made a rough sketch in my head of what I wanted the code to look like. My plan was to have a while loop to scan through inputs to see if the `options` button was pressed. If it was I wanted to continue to the main game. In the main game I planed a while loop that continued scanned through the inputs to see what’s being pressed. If it registered a button press I wanted to see what button it was, store it in a variable, and then have a series of `elif` statements that would continue the game if the right button is pressed and exit if the wrong button was pressed. And then I wanted the program to automatically exit after 10 seconds.

# So… what did I end up doing?

## Generating a random button

I started by creating a function that would create the random button that the user would have to press. I achieved this with the following function: 
```c
    char* random_button() {
        char* buttons[16] = {"triangle", "circle", ... "right"};
        char button = rand() % 16;
        return buttons[button];
    }
```

This function creates a character array (using a pointer) with 16 values, one for each button. It then creates a variable called `button` that returns a randomized button of one of the values in the `buttons[16]` array. So that every time I call the function `random_button()` it generates a new random button. 

## Entering the game

```c
    while(1){
        scanf("%d, ... %d", &triangle, ... &right);
        if (options == 1) {
            printf("Welcome to the wonderful world of the Gamemaster. Enjoy this game of bop it! \n");
            game_start = 1;
            sleep(1);
            while (options == 1) {
                scanf("%d, ... %d", &triangle, ... &right);
                if (options == 0) {
                    break;
                }
            }
            break;
            }
    }
```
This is the function that I created to enter the game when the `options` button is pressed. It does this through a while loop that scans through all the inputs from the controller. It then, if `options == 1` prints `”Welcome to...”` and sets `game_start = 1;`. The `game_start` variable is what, later in the code, allows for it to enter the main loop. Afterwords it breaks out of the loop and continues the program. 

## The beuatiful (not really) game itself 

### How I check if the button is right

I use another custom function in order to check if the right button is pressed. 

```c
	int is_correct_button(char* button, int triangle, ... int right) {
    
        time_t start_time = time(NULL);
        int time_limit = 5;

    while (time(NULL) - start_time < time_limit) {
    

        scanf("%d, ... %d", &triangle, ... &right);


        if (strcmp(button, "triangle") ==0) {
            if (triangle == 1) {
                return 1;
            }
            else if (circle == 1 || ... right == 1) {
                return 0;
            }
	.
      .
      .
        if (strcmp(button, "right") ==0) {
            if (right == 1) {
                return 1;
            }
            else if (circle == 1 || ... triangle == 1) {
                return 0;
            }
        }
    }
    

    return(1);

	}
```
So walking through this a bit. It takes in both the random button that’s created, as well as the input variable for every button. It then sets the time so that the user only has a maximum of 5 seconds in order to gather an input. It then checks to see what the `button` is by using strcmp. Then, if the user presses the button, it returns 1. If the user presses anything else (so any other button on the controller will be set to 1), and then will return 0. 

### Cool, but then what do I do now?

Now I see if the right button was pressed, and then, if the right button was pressed, print a message and then get a new random button. 

```c
    while (inner_loop == 1) {

        if (time(NULL) - start_time > time_limit) {
            printf("Time's up!\n");
            printf("You got %d right\n", right_ammount);
            exit(0);
        }

        scanf("%d, ... %d", &triangle, ... &right);

        if (is_correct_button(button, triangle, ... right) == 1) {
            if (triangle == 1) {
                printf("Good job matey\n");
                good_job = 1;
                ++right_ammount;
                break;
            } 
            .
            .
            .
            } else if (right == 1) {
                printf("Good job matey\n");
                good_job = 1;
                ++right_ammount;
                break;
            }
        }
        
    if (is_correct_button(button, triangle, ... right) != 1) {
        printf("You pressed the wrong button. try again\n");
        printf("you got %d right\n", right_ammount);
        exit(0);
    }
```


First set a timer so that the user only has a certain amount of time to play the game, and the time limit gets shorter every time that it’s ran (implemented in the loop one level above this), and it starts at 10 seconds. Then, if `is_correct_button == 1` it checks here if the right button was pressed. Then, if it was, it iterated `right_ammount` and prints a good job message and breaks to the upper loop. 

Then, if `is_correct_button ≠ 1` then it prints both the number of buttons that the player has gotten right, and then tells the user to try again before exiting. 

I’m realizing now that this is probably very redundant with the function itself. But hey, it works, so I’m not about to complain. For this lab I think I’m at the point where I don’t really care anymore if or how the mess that I’ve created works, all that I care about is that it does. 

### The outer loop that definitely does very cool things
```c
    while (game_start == 1 && time_limit > 0) {

        start:

        options = 0;

        button = random_button();
        printf("Press this random button: %s\n", button);



    time_limit--;

        inner_loop = 1;

        sleep(1);
    while (triangle == 1 || circle == 1 || ... right == 1) {
        scanf("%d, ... %d, %d", &triangle, ... &right);
        if (triangle == 0 && circle == 0 ... right == 0) {
            break;
    }
    }
```
The outer loop’s primary function is to do three things. Get and print the random button, iterate the `time_limit` every iteration, and check to make sure that nothing’s being pressed in order to avoid extraneous button presses. 

So how I decided to avoid any extraneous button presses, and shoutout to the TA that suggested that I do this, is to have the program in a while loop if any button is being pressed (so the value would be 1), and then exit the while loop when ALL the button’s are being read as 0, meaning that no button is being pressed. It then enters the inner loop, where the user inputs a new button that (hopefully) matches the random button that’s assigned to the `button` variable.

# Random things that I wanted to add

- Nowhere in the instructions or the requirements does it say that the time left has to be printed. It’s shown in the demo, but it’s NOT in the requirements for the lab
- This is the longest program that I’ve ever written :)
    - I’m pretty sure that a lot of the code is redundant
    - This record was passed right after I wrote this report by the midterm project, clocking in at a whopping 456 lines of code
- As always, this code is published under GPLv3. And, because I was getting frustrated and wanted version control, this code is also published on [my github](https://github.com/munkycool)
- I was at HACC (hacking and cybersecurity club) and saw someone implement a code block in Markdown using \`\`\` \[code\] \`\`\` So enjoy the beautifully formatted and syntax highlighted code in this report!
