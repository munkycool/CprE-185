# Part two, more fun! (I’m crying on the inside)

## 2_1, wait, it ain’t even compile?

I’m not sure if this was supposed to happen, but it wouldn’t compile. So I changed the following assignments:

- `int input == 0;` to `int input = 0;`
- `if (is_odd(input) = 1)` to `if (is_odd(input) == 1)`
- `if (is_even(input) = 1)` to `if (is_even(input) == 1)`

It now compiles and works perfectly, with the following output: 

![2_1 final output](../../../Pictures/Screenshots/Screenshot 2024-02-14 at 14.42.16.png)

I’m not sure if it was supposed to not work and then work, but that’s what happened ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

### All changes made

- line 34: `    int input = 0; // changed from "==" to "="`
- line 39: `    if (is_odd(input) == 1) //changed from "=" "=="`
- line 44: `    if (is_even(input) == 1) //changed from "=" "=="`

## 2_2,  huh, that ain’t seem right

I changed the variables from `double` to `int` in the function `how_many_whole_digits` and it fixed it!

![2_2 final output](../../../Pictures/Screenshots/Screenshot 2024-02-14 at 14.57.41.png)

### All changes made

- lines 57-84: `/*
I changed the variable's in the if statements to int type instead of the double type that they were before.
*/
    if (number / 10000000 != 0)
    {
        printf("8 digits\n");
    } else if (number / 1000000 != 0)
    {
        printf("7 digits\n");
    } else if (number / 100000 != 0)
    {
        printf("6 digits\n");
    } else if (number / 10000 != 0)
    {
        printf("5 digits\n");
    } else if (number / 1000 != 0)
    {
        printf("4 digits\n");
    } else if (number / 100 != 0)
    {
        printf("3 digits\n");
    } else if (number / 10 != 0)
    {
        printf("2 digits\n");
    } else if (number / 1 != 0)
    {
        printf("1 digit\n");
    }`

## 2_3, I wonder what this’ll be about?

This is another one that wouldn’t compile until I fixed it, and then after I fixed it and compiled it the program worked excactly as expected. 

I changed `scanf("%lf %lf", &first, &second);` to `scanf("%d %d", &first, &second);`. The problem being the data types being called were int, not double. 

The output:

![2_3 final output](../../../Pictures/Screenshots/Screenshot 2024-02-14 at 16.51.09.png)

### All changes made

- line 37: `    scanf("%d %d", &first, &second); // changed from %lf`

## 2_4, oh shit, here we go again

As the title implies, this problem actually had pretty much the same error, except this time it was in the variable declaration and not the variable calling. And, once again, it failed to compile until I fixed the problem, afterwords it ran perfectly. 

To fix the problem, I changed `int v, i, r;` to `double v, i, r;`. And the problem was solved!

The output: 

![2_4 final output](../../../Pictures/Screenshots/Screenshot 2024-02-14 at 16.55.31.png)

### All changes made

- line 37: `    double v, i, r; //changed from int to double`

## 2_5, I wonder what this will be ¯\_(⊙︿⊙)_/¯

This one again didn’t compile, so I went through and fixed it ( ͡ᵔ ͜ʖ ͡ᵔ )

I changed `if (number = 0)` to `if (number == 0)`, and I also changed `printf("%d is zero and ", n);` to `printf("%d is zero and ", number);`. After I did both of those things, the code compiled, and it gave the answers as expected. One thing though is that when entering a decimal, it says it’s a whole number. Looking at the code, I think that’s a shortcoming of the code, and not a logical error of the code itself. 

The output: 

![2_5 final output](../../../Pictures/Screenshots/Screenshot 2024-02-14 at 17.08.29.png)

### All changes made

- line 110: `    if (number == 0) // changed = to ==`
- line 112: `        printf("%d is zero and ", number); // changed the variable from "n" to "number"`


# Part 3, When I have to put it all together even though I don’t want to but I know that I have to because the thing said that I should, but I also know that I don’t want to, but I know that I must, and I know that I must because the thing…

I made a whole bunch of changes, and hoped that I made note of everything that I did change. 

And here’s the output of the program (minus a few lines because I wasn’t the strongest guesser that round ಠ╭╮ಠ )

![Part 3 final output](../../../Pictures/Screenshots/Screenshot 2024-02-14 at 17.33.46.png)

# The questions at the end

1. There were a number of changes made, please refer to the accompanying source code documents for a more in depth list
2. There were a variety of issues made, again please refer to the source code
3. I’ll admit, I didn’t use the -Wall flag. VSCode did a good job of flagging the problems that the code was using, as well as its built in debugger. The purpose of it though is, I’m assuming, to give a more in-depth view of the code and the potential problems that the code had. And no, you don’t have to fix everything that the -Wall command shows (I’m assuming lol).
